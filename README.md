# recipe

# Recipe Finder

This web application is built using React and consumes the Spoonacular API to fetch recipes from a food database. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, cuisine types, or dietary restrictions.

## Features

- Clean Code: The JavaScript code follows best practices, is well-structured, and uses proper naming conventions. Components are separated into reusable modules for easier maintenance.

- Scalability: The application is designed to handle a growing number of recipes and users. Components and modules are built with extensibility and modifiability in mind.

- Asynchronous JavaScript: The application utilizes JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities to make API requests and handle responses without blocking the user interface.

- Lightweight and Fast Loading: Code and assets are optimized to minimize load times. Lazy loading is implemented for images, and code splitting is used to reduce the initial load size.

- Proper Browsing Rendering Techniques: Server-side rendering (SSR) can be implemented using frameworks like Next.js to improve search engine optimization and enhance the initial page load performance.

- Industry Security Standards: The application applies appropriate security measures, including input validation and authentication, to protect user data and prevent common security vulnerabilities.

- Git Version Control: The source code is managed using Git, allowing for easier tracking of changes and collaboration with others.
